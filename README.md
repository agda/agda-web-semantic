Agda Semantic Web Libraries
===========================

These libraries are intended to support processing of semantic web data in Agda,
and to ensure that all such data satisfies its integrity constraints, expressed
as an ontology.

The data is expressed in terms of the W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF),
and ontoloties are expressed in terms of the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL).

The semantics of RDF and OWL are given as Description Logics,
formalized in the Web.Semantic.DL library.
